This script runs Autotools, for use before running ./configure.
Only use it if you cannot obtain a version of autotools with autoreconf.
Otherwise, "autoreconf -vfi" is a better alternative to this script.
Use this script at your own risk. If this does not work either, you can
try each command yourself until you find where errors occur.

Short summary of what each command does:
libtoolize - copies/links support scripts e.g. ltmain.sh
glibtoolize - same thing for other platforms i.e. Mac
aclocal - copies over m4 macros needed by configure script
autoconf - build configure.ac macros into configure script
automake -  reads Makefile.am files and generates Makefile.in files
--add-missing - adds files needed by Automake if they are not there
