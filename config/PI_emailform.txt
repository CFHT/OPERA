Dear Dr. |PI|,

On |DATE|, the QSO Team took data for your program(s). The data have
been reduced and are now available through the URL given to you earlier.
Please check the data carefully, and notify qsoteam@cfht.hawaii.edu if
there is any problem with the quality of the data (other than loss of S/N
to weather or bad seeing), the date/time of the observation (if you
requested specific timing or monitoring). If the QSO Team has made a
mistake, we will correct it as much as possible, if we are notified as
soon as possible.

If you receive this email, it means that you may use the tool cfhtget
now to retrieve your data. If you use wget, you will have to wait a couple
more hours before wget determines which files are available.

Your data hhas been reduced by the opera-1.0 open source pipeline.
Documentation on opera may be found at:

Regards,
The OPERA QSO Team
