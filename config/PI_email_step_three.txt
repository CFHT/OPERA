Dear Dr. |PI|,

Welcome to opera-1.0. We would like to proceed with the installation installation
in careful steps.

The third step is to install opera itself on your computer:

1. Download the compressed file: opera-1.0.zip from sourceforge.net:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/opera-pipeline/files/opera-1.0/opera-1.0-Jul01-2013.zip/download

2. Remove an existing copy if you have one:

   cd ~
   rm -rf opera-1.0/
   
3. Unpack this file in your home directory:
   unzip opera-1.0.zip

4. Open a terminal and access the directory 
   cd $HOME/opera-1.0/ 

5. Run the configuration file, thusly if you have libpng installed:
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opera-1.0/ --enable-LIBPNG=true
   or if not:
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opera-1.0/
     
6. Build: 
   make install
   . ./setup.sh

If the installation was successful please read all the documentation in the doc/ directory before processding.

Regards,
The OPERA Team
