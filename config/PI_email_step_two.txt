Dear Dr. |PI|,

The second step is to install the dependencies on your computer.

We strove to minimize the dependencies. There are only four. You MUST install these in 
the order shown and the installation MUST complete correctly. If a step fails, stop, 
and send an email to opera@cfht.hawaii.edu for help.

The dependencies are:

- cfitsio -- (mandatory) read and write FITS images				
			-- http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html
				Download the Linux version into your home directory and do the simplified steps
				(ignore all the warnings):
				cd cfitsio
				./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
				make
				sudo make install

- FFTW3   -- (mandatory)FFT Library
			-- download from http://www.fftw.org/
				Download the Linux version into your home directory and do the simplified steps:
				cd fftw-3.3
				./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
				make
				sudo make install

- lz		-- (mandatory) used to compress intermediate results
			-- download from http://www.zlib.net/
				cd zlib-<version>
				./configure
				make
				sudo make install
			   
Stop immediately and contact opera@cfht.hawaii.edu if a step fails.

Please send an email to opera@cfht.hawaii.edu when these steps have completed successfully to
receive the next set of instructions.


Regards,
The OPERA Team
