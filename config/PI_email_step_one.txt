Dear Dr. |PI|,

Welcome to opera-1.0. We would like to proceed with the installation
in careful steps.

The first step is ensuring that g++ and gcc are installed on your computer.

We have successfull installations on Linux Kernel 2.6.x.x, and MacOSX - Snow Leopard, 
Lion and Mountain Lion:

Snow Leopard	- 10.6
Lion			- 10.7
Mountain Lion	- 10.8

Older versions of MacOSX can be tricky because gcc of the appropriate version may be difficult
to locate. The command line tools were bundled at one point with XCode, and later were
unbundled and required a separate installation. If you have trouble locating the correct version
command line tools please send an email to opera@cfht.hawaii.edu for help.

- gcc/g++	-- compiles with version 3.x.x and up to 4.2.x of gcc, note that version 2.x.x 
			   has problems (no template suppport) and is not supported.
			-- first determine which version of gcc and g++ you have, do this in a terminal window:
				g++ -v
				gcc -v
				
Installation of C/C++ on Linux is complex enough that you should ask your sysadmin to do it for you.

If your version os less than 3.4.6 please upgrade. On linux, have your sysadmin upgrade for you.

- XCode	-- FOR MAC USERS ONLY 
			- used to browse the opera-1.0 project on a mac and also
			   to get a gcc compiler to build the above libraries...
			- BUT you do need the command line tools!
			- http://developer.apple.com
				- you must register as a mac developer
				- go to the xcode download page
				- download Code and install it
				- download the command line tools extras and install it (includes gcc or llvm-gcc)

Please send an email to opera@cfht.hawaii.edu when these steps have completed successfully to
receive the next set of instructions.

Regards,
The OPERA Team
